<h3 >About the event</h3>

<p>The goal of this event is to promote the growth of problem solving skills and the collaboration among engineering students of all disciplines to solve real world problems. Very few events like this exist and it would be overwhelmingly beneficial not only to Mizzou engineering students but also to Mizzouâ€™s College of Engineering and companies looking to find students who are interested in personal growth in the engineering field and interested in tackling important engineering problems.</p>

<p>TigerBuilds is a one day event on April 23. The event will begin with check-in at 8:00am on Saturday morning. Participants will then be given an introduction to the event providing a framework and the goals of the event. Participants will then break into teams of fellow engineering students (of any engineering discipline). </p>

<p>Once teams are formed they will then proceed to research common problems within industries/problem areas which include (but are not limited to) education, communication, transportation, water drought/conservation, disaster response/assistance, and crime monitoring/prevention. Sponsoring companies may also provide problems specific to their respective fields of work for participants to solve. Teams will have roughly a day to research, engineer, and develop their solutions within their diverse teams. Judging of solutions will be done by Mizzou Engineering professors and sponsor company volunteers. </p>

<p>After judging ensues prize-winning solutions will be announced and teams will have the opportunity to present their solutions and collaborate further among members of different teams, faculty, and company representatives. This event has the potential to bring the benefits of already widely existing computer science Hack-a-thons to all disciplines of engineering. Furthermore, and most importantly, TigerBuilds provides students the opportunity to work across engineering disciplines while fostering an environment for innovative thinking. </p>
